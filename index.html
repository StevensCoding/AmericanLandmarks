        <h2 class="top">What's the point?</h2>
        <p>Some people would go their ENTIRE life without exploring what the world has to offer outside of their own state; some even their own city! This page is dedicated to helping you see where some places are and how beautiful you can imagine it to be in person.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2 class="top">Would these places be expensive to visit?</h2>
      <p>The cost of travel will vary from place to place but a landmark doesn't have a price point. All you have to do is go there and see it for yourself!
      </p>
