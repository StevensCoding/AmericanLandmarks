    <h2 >What's the point?</h2>
    <p>Some people would go their ENTIRE life without exploring what the world has to offer outside of their own state; some even their own city! This page is dedicated to helping you see where some places are and how beautiful you can imagine it to be in person.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="flex-container">
    <h2 >Would these places be expensive to visit?</h2>
    <p>The cost of travel will vary from place to place but a landmark doesn't have a price point. All you have to do is go there and see it for yourself! </p>
   </div>
   <div class="flex-container">
    <h2 >Can I see some?</h2>
    <p>Sure! All you have to do is grab your mouse and scroll down a little bit. Give that button a push!</p>
